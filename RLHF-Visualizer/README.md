The RLHF pipeline contains a lot of components, and it is very difficult for people to visualize the pipeline. 

Hence I have created this visualizer which can explain what exactly happens to a single completion as it passes through the pipeline. 

This visualization explains the entire pipeline with a lot of clarity so that people do not have any doubts with respect to the components involved in the RHF pipeline.
